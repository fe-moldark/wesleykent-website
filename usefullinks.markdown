You'll likely see these links / tools referenced throughout the various exploits from the CTFs, but I thought I would start a list here and add onto it with time.
<br><br>
<br>
For a massive of list of tried and true methods of bypassing misconfigured system, I give you: [**gtfobins**](https://gtfobins.github.io/)<br><br>
For everything to do with exploiting command executions vulnerabilities to get yourself a shell: [**pentestmonkey**](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)<br><br>
Note: For a more in depth explanation on these two links, [**this page on my site**](/tipsandtricks/privilegeescalation/) goes over some examples.
<br><br><br>
If you want to branch out of the CTFs from the sites I mentioned on the [**resource**s](/resources/) page, then go after sites like [**hackthissite**](https://www.hackthissite.org/), there are many like it out there.
<br><br>
Something I have yet to create for this site is an overview of [**wireshark**](https://www.wireshark.org/) and how to use it, but I would be far from the first person to create a page or blog on that.
<br><br>
<br>
Lastly, any blog or website out there. Other people have likely had your exact same question, and it might be floating out there on the internet somewhere, so leverage the internet's resources in your favor.
