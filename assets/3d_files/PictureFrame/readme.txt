Frame to hold a poster / picture appx. 174mm wide by 268mm tall.

Uses a total of 16 1mm screws, 3-4mm tall with a 5mm head. These connect the two main pieces as well as each of the four corners. The frame uses pressure from the corners to hold the poster / picture in place.

STL files will fit onto the bed of an Ender 3 Pro, or 220mm x 220m.


You should be able to scale this up or down as needed, but the screws will need to change as that happens.
