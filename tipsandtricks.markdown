Like I might have mentioned before, my memory might not be the best, but even if it was I would still keep these notes. Sometimes the syntax gets complicated or you just don't want to search for that one exploit you read about once from a random blog months back. I hope others can find this as useful as I have, and if you have anything you think I should include here, by all means [reach out](/contact/).<br>
<br>
There is far too much for just one web page, so I've broken this down into the following categories.

This page covers brute forcing passwords and logins using tools like Hydra, John, and Burpsuite. This is a core part of pen testing, whether you're using John to break private SSH keys you've gotten your hands on or using Hydra to brute force a login to a vulnerable web portal.
<br><br>
[**>>Privilege Escalation<<**](/tipsandtricks/privilegeescalation/)<br>
The myriad of ways for privilege escalation. At a glance, knowing how to list files / programs that have higher privileges, increasing your shell's capabilities, modifying access controls - I don't know there's a lot to go over here, check out the page for more info.
