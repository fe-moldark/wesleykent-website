[**>>Securing my sites from the perspective of the CIA Triad<<**](/scripts/websitehashing/)<br>
Couple of scripts I wrote to verify the integrity of my websites. Fun project, and useful - this was basically the first script I started implementing with the crontab. Lots of learning moments here.

[**>>RPi stock availability and daily Dilbert Comics<<**](/scripts/rpi_and_dilbert/)<br>
Simple scripts to notify me when various RPi boards are back in stock and a script that sends me the current Dilbert comic during work days at 9am sharp.
