[**>>Securing my sites from the perspective of the CIA Triad<<**](/scripts/websitehashing/)<br>
Collection of scripts I wrote to verify the integrity of my websites. Fun project, and useful - this was basically the first times I started implementing scripts with the crontab. Lots of learning moments here.
<br><br>
[**>>RPi stock availability and daily Dilbert Comics<<**](/scripts/rpi_and_dilbert/)<br>
Simple scripts to notify me when various RPi boards are back in stock and a script that sends me the current Dilbert comic during work days at 9am sharp.
<br><br>
[**>>Writing my own Cipher<<**](/scripts/creating_my_own_cipher/)<br>
This consists of two scripts which are used to first encrypt text-based information into an image and then the second script to decrypt it back. The data goes through several rounds of manipulation before being encoded, uses a symmetric key stored within the image, and as far as I can tell remains safe from frequency analysis.
