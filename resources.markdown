To start off, the CTFs I enjoy working through can be found at [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
<br><br>
Since I've started learning about exploits and different commands / tools to use I have kept fairly decent job of taking notes and saving links. For this subpage of the site I've included [useful links here](/resources/usefullinks/) and my recommended [fresh install for Linux here](/resources/freshinstall/).
