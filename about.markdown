The home page does a decent job of explaining the purpose of this site, so I won't go over it again here. Instead -

Who I am:<br>
My name is Wesley Kent, I am currently studying Cybersecurity at American Military University, with a concentration in Wireless and Mobile Security. I've begun working through the CompTIA certifications and as of the Summer of 2022 I have obtained my Security+ and A+ certifications, with the Network+ and CySA+ in the works. Right now I am working as an IT Technician getting some hands-on experience before I transition to the security side of IT.
