"Hello there" - If you've made it to this corner of the internet, then welcome.
<br><br>
This site documents several exploits I’ve explored through TryHackMe and Hack The Box, and some useful tricks I've learned along the way. There's some shameless self-promotion to my side project at <a href="https://fe-moldark.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fe-moldark.dev</a> where I am working to completely recreate Fire Emblem. I’ve also included some projects I’ve made with Raspberry Pis and electronics - everything from dashcams, VPN servers and retro-gaming machines. Lastly, there are pages for network intrusion stuff you can set up and configure yourself, the game console I designed, printed, and assembled from scratch, and some random scripts you might find useful.
<br><br>
Enjoy,
<br><br>
