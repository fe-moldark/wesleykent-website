"Hello there" - If you've made it to this corner of the internet, then welcome.
<br><br>
This site documents several exploits I’ve explored through TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and some useful tricks I've learned along the way. There's some shameless self-promotion to my side project at <a href="https://fe-moldark.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fe-moldark.dev</a> where I am working to completely recreate a favorite childhood game of mine. I’ve also included some projects I’ve made with Raspberry Pis - everything from dashcams, VPN servers and retro-gaming machines. Lastly, there are pages for USB injectors and ciphers I've written, the game console I am designing with Matter Control, and some scripts you might find useful.
<br><br>
Enjoy,
<br><br>
