<p>
Welcome to <b>wesleykent.com</b>, a site unsurprisingly created by someone named Wesley Kent - and that's me.
<br><br>
This site documents several exploits I’ve explored through TryHackMe and HackTheBox, and some useful tricks I've learned along the way. There's some shameless self-promotion to my side project at <a href="https://fe-moldark.dev">fe-moldark.dev</a> where I am working to completely recreate a favorite childhood game of mine. I’ve also included some projects I’ve made with raspberry pis - everything from dashcams, VPN servers and retro game consoles.
<br><br>
Enjoy.
