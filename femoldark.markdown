I won't go into detail here because I have created an entirely seperate website for this topic at [**fe-moldark.dev**](https://www.fe-moldark.dev).
<br><br>
Summarized, this is a game I have been recreating with Python / Pygame from the ground up, literally started at nothing and now the project stands at around 16,000 lines of code. The game I am recreating is Fire Emblem, more specifically the older versions as seen on the GBA and DS since that is what I grew up with. This is a project that has been ongoing for many years now with just as many breaks in between. Life happens and you get busy I guess.
<br><br>
Again, a lot to say about this but there is a website that does so better and in more detail, so click the link above if you are interested. To maybe pique your interest I'll include some screenshots of the gameplay / graphics I've created for this project. Enjoy.
