I won't go into detail here since I have already created an entirely separate website for this topic at [fe-moldark.dev](https://www.fe-moldark.dev).
<br><br>
Summarized, this is a game I have been recreating with Python / Pygame from the ground up, literally started at nothing and the project now stands at around 16,000 lines of code. The game I am recreating is Fire Emblem, more specifically the older versions as seen on the GBA and DS since that is what I grew up with. This is a project that has been ongoing for many years now with just as many breaks in between. Life happens and you get busy I guess.
<br><br>
One thing I will note is that the end goal is to play this game on a case that I will make using a 3D printer I recently purchased. I've been working on the design for a couple months now and figuring out what parts I will need, however some initial tests on my Pi 3B+ showed the processor was too slow. Thankfully, I don't think the issue is in my code, rather times when the screen has to blit numerous surfaces with some transparent parts that need the `convert_alpha()` - that's not really something I can get around. That being said, I have purchased a BananaPi M5 and that has provided more than enough additional computing power so far.
<br><br>
Again, a lot to say about this but there is a separate website that does so better and in more detail, so click the link above if you are interested. To maybe pique your interest I'll include some screenshots of the gameplay / graphics I've created for this project. Enjoy.
