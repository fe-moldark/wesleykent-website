# TryHackMe - Simple SMB Exploit
The following post will cover material from TryHackMe along the Cyber Defense path. If you want to learn more about the SMB protocol I would highly encourage you to reference the TryHackMe site as they will provide a much more in depth break down of how the protocol works than I will get into here.
<br><br>
Essentially SMB, or Server Message Block Protocol, is used to give remote access to certain files and connected devices (e.g. printers) on a network using client-server communication protocol. It's easy to draw similarities between this and FTP, and although they do have different purposes, some of the syntax is the same across the board.
<br><br>
Let's start off the box with a basic nmap scan of the target:<br>

We see a couple of ports running some SMB services over ports 139 and 445.
<br><br>
We can use `enum4linux` that will enumerate SMB shares and users for us. There are multiple flags we can choose from, for now we will run with the `-a` for all the core scanning / enumeration options.<br>

<p align="center"><img width="750" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/users-name-of-server-and-share-names.png"></p>
Here we begin finding out more information about the SMB shares, including names, workgroups, and versions.<br><br>
We can access the shares via: `smbclient //IP/SHARE`<br><br>
The `profiles` share is of interest, and it's as good a place to start as any.<br>
We can now try and login into that share anonymously:<br>
<p align="center"><img width="750" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/img.webp"></p>
The "Working From Home Information.txt" file sounds interesting, which we can then `get` to our machine:<br>
<p align="center"><img width="850" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/get working from home note.png"></p>
On that file we find clear information indicating that we should further investigate how the users are remotely accessing their machines, namely through ssh. There is a .ssh directory on the SMB share and we find the following:<br>
<p align="center"><img width="800" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/cdssh.png"></p>
Now, we can try to login via ssh since we have a workable rsa-id, however we still do not have the username. What we do have is the name of the individual "John Cactus" from the "Working From Home Information.txt" file - hopefully the company auto assigns usernames such as FirstInitialLastName, FirstName, LastName, LastNameFirstname, so on so forth. To use the rsa_id we first need to change the permissions of our id_rsa file and give just ourselves full read/write access:<br>
<p align="center"><img width="300" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/chmod.png"></p>
After a few failed attempts to guess the username, I eventually got the following to work:<br>
<p align="center"><img width="750" src="/assets/blog/THM-SMB/ssh in and see flag.png"></p>
And right there in the current working directory we find the flag we're looking for. Cheers,<br><br>
